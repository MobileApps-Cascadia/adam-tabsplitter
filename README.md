Tab Splitter jQuery Protoype
============================

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this app is to allow for precise and specific splitting of a purchase among multiple people. If
someone is unable to pay for their part, the user can store what the person owes on a different page with
information as to what the purchase was, how much, when, etc. There is also a settings page that will add tax,
split the bill evenly or unevenly, and more various options.

Target Audience
---------------

The target audience for this app would mainly be college students or other young adults who go out frequently with
a group of friends who split the tab. This could also be targeted for business associates who go out to eat with each
other, a group of family friends, and maybe even for parents to use just to keep count of how much their kids owe them!
